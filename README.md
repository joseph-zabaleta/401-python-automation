## Overview  
A colleague has abruptly left the team to pursue a career as a novelist.

This colleague’s last days (and weeks) on the job were a mixed bag in terms of productivity.

Looking through the documents left behind there is some important contact into in the form of email addresses and phone numbers.

Unfortunately it’s mixed in with a bunch of useless notes.

Your job is to find the needles in the haystack.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements  
- [ ] Given a set of text documents, find and collect all email addresses and phone numbers.  
- Phone numbers may be in various formats.
  - (xxx) yyy-zzzz, yyy-zzzz, xxx-yyy-zzzz, etc.  
  - phone numbers with missing area code should presume 206
  - phone numbers should be stored in xxx-yyy-zzzz format.
- [ ] Once emails and phone numbers are found they should be stored in two separate documents.
- [ ] The information should be sorted in ascending order.
